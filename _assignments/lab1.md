This lab is designed to introduce you to the tools and simulator that will be used for the remaining of the course. The lab is very simple and should take less than 30 minutes to complete. If you're struggling with completing the lab, please see me in my office because you do not have the necessary background to take the course and I will help you catch up with the course prerequisites.
